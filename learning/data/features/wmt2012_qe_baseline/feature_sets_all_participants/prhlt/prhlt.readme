We report a total of 497 features. Many of them are intentionally
repeated or are non-informative to test the efficiency of the feature
selection techniques presented in the competition. The following table
contains the different types of features, the number of features of
each type, and the positions in which they appear in the csv file:

  - First, we compute word confidence scores according to several 
    criteria: 4 alignment criteria and 3 scoring criteria, for a 
    total of 12 scores per word. Then, we report the number of 
    previously unseen words (score equal to 0), average word score,
    and number of words in each quartile. See:

  - We compute a new correctness score for each word, taking as 
    features several wcNgFeats. The score is given by a smoothed
    naive Bayes classifier. We computed one classifier for each

     In Proceedings of the MT Summit XI. Springer-Verlag.
    From the word scores given by each classifier
    we report the average score, the percentage of correct words 
    (threshold tuned to optimize classification error rate), and the 
    number of words in each quartile.
