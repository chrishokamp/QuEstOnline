This file contains the feature sets from all (but 1) systems that participated in WMT-12 QE shared task.

For each system, a folder identified by team name (acronym of institution, followed by first author's name, when necessary) containing the following files is provided:

- <team-name>.features.train.cvs
- <team-name>.features.test.cvs
- <team-name>.readme

The 2 first files contain all features used for training (1,832 instances) and test (422 instances) in CVS format, where the first line contains a simple, sequencial feature ID. The third file contains some information about the features, or a simple ordered list of features. 

To note:

- there is some overlap between feature sets, in particular, most of them use the 17 baseline features
- dfki-maja contains only features for the test set, as this method did not involve any training. Please contact Maja Popovic (maja.popovic@dfki.de) if you'd like to have features for the training set extracted too.
- some feature sets contain "?" for instances where those feature values were not defined: dfki-eleftherios and upc
