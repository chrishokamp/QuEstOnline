\f0\fs24 \cf0 Norway's rakfisk: Is this the world's smelliest fish?\
Norway's five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not just in Europe, but in the world.\
Could the secret of the country's success be connected to the local appetite for some exceedingly smelly fish?\
Take a selection of over-ripe cheeses.\
Place them in the midst of a pile of dirty, wet soccer kit.\
Leave for a week.\
Now You have the nose-numbing smell of rakfisk, one of the great Norwegian delicacies.\
I am in the small town of Fagernes, acerca three hours from Oslo.\
There is snow, spectacular scenery - and That odor, ever present, hangs in the air.\
Rakfisk is trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for - Depending on how you like your smelly fish - up to a year.\
As the dark sets in and the weather turns cold, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes devoted to this most, well, captivating of foods.\
"You eat it raw, and then swallow a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, Local full-time firefighter But Also the so-called "General Rakfisk," in charge of running the festival.\
All around us people are eating little cubes of the fish and knocking back quantities of drink.\
"Some people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk," says Havard.\
The drink can kill the smell.\
I try a few pieces.\
If you can avoid passing it under your nose, it is not bad - not Unlike a slice of sushi That have been on rather a long bus journey.\
Rakfisk is a product of very different, poverty-stricken times in Norway when, pre-refrigeration, fish was soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in autumn.\
Then in the depths of winter, well and truly fermented, it is taken out and - no doubt With The senses knocked out by Alcohol - eaten.\
Only a generation ago, Thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave Their country in search of work, mainly emigrating to the U.S..\
Now the population is expanding fast - more than 13% are immigrants, Attracted by plentiful jobs, high wages and a comprehensive care system.\
People from Sweden, the old rival and not so long ago far richer than Norway, stream in to work.\
Rakfisk is seen as signifying something important, if rather smelly a vital part of Norway's past.\
It is Among the more expensive dishes you can buy.\
But then everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich knock you back \'a3 9 ($ 14) each.\
Norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda, - and Most seem to like it That Way.\
People here are still loath to mention by name Anders Breivik, the right-wing, racist extremist who gunned down and killed 77 men, women and children last year.\
Instead, the shootings are Referred to as "the 22nd July the incident."\
Norwegians find it very Difficult to Believe That In Their peace-loving country was one of Their Own capable of Such brutality and murder.\
The growth since the early 1970s of one of the world's biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of Norway's present-day wealth.\
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well," says Anna our waitress, handing round trays of maturing rakfisk and, with her long blond hair and startlingly blue eyes, the image of Nordic well-being.\
We are a - how you say - prudent people.\
Her Ingl\'e9s, like that of Most people here, is flawless.\
We are not very showy, we do not like ostentation.\
Norway has handled very Carefully its oil wealth - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is Invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.\
When everyone else was throwing around money They did not have, in the years leading up to the global financial crash, Norway kept its purse strings tightly bound.\
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in summer we are happy," says Anna.\
"And eat rakfisk," she adds with a carefree laugh.\
I stand in the snow and queue for something to eat - I have had enough rakfisk.\
Now an elk burger Certainly is something different and rather succulent to the taste.\
But in the evening, it is more of That smelly fish.\
The hotel I am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a dinner rakfisk where guests vote on the best - or Perhaps The most nasally challenging - fish.\
There is a live TV link up to a compere in a bow tie surrounded by plates of rakfisk.\
It is like the Eurovision song contest.\
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains Thor-Juergen?"\
"Here are our points, Havard."\
There is clapping, laughter.\
A man falls off his chair, Perhaps Overcome with aquavit.\
Or maybe it is the fumes from all that fish.\
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces tough start\
As Mexico's incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population.\
Traffic in Mexico City is Particularly bad at present.\
A congested city at the best of times, a ring of steel has been erected since Sunday cutting off several key routes into the capital city and Causing chaos on the roads.\
The aim, however it, was not to stop commuters getting to work but Prevent protesters from reaching parliament.\
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential sash and take over the running of the nation.\
He faces a complicated task.\
Mexico has been performing well Economically under the outgoing administration of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, que Claimed Already have an Estimated 60,000 lives in six years.\
"My government has a great Commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence," Mr Pena Nieto Told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office Earlier this week.\
I will be proposing a new security strategy Which will allow us to Achieve That aim.\
Before rubbing shoulders With The U.S. president, Mr Pena Nieto's previous political experience was as governor of his home state, the State of Mexico.\
A populous, sprawling state surrounding the capital about the new leader opinions are divided in his old stomping ground.\
A straightforward man\
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered fondly.\
Residents credit him with boosting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure.\
To reach the town you can drive along one of Mr Pena Nieto's new motorways, a vast improvement on the cracked and bumpy roads it replaced.\
Plaques bearing his name Also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum acerca climate change.\
"We are looking to him to bring acerca Real and lasting change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman for Mr Pena Nieto's party, the PRI.\
Particularly in terms of security and the economy, we're hoping for an interesting and true Which change our country so badly needs.\
After an unbroken 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox\
Congressman admits Olvera That after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there is much expectation Within the party acerca Enrique Pena Nieto.\
And I rejects the opposition's Characterisation of the new president as lacking substance.\
He's a very straightforward man, very Committed With An excellent vision of the country.\
He's an excellent statesman and, above all, he's someone who knows how to listen.\
But on the other side of the state, That is not the impression many People Have of Their former governor.\
In Nezahualcoyotl, Also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast With The cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be sharper.\
Tucked away under motorway flyovers, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.\
And the problems in the municipality are Also gritty and urban.\
Earlier This Year, the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the Neighbourhoods, and violence against women is Particularly acute.\
On a patch of wasteland by a vast landfill site, the bodies of dozens of murdered Women Have been dumped over the past two years alone.\
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr Pena Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous With The murder of innocent women.\
Mr Pena Nieto's critics say, at best, have failed to Adequately address the problem of femicide while I was in office.\
At worst, They accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.\
In a concrete home typical of the rundown neighborhood, Buendia Irinea Struggles to fight back the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter, Mariana Moon.\
According To the official version of events, Mariana Committed suicide in 2010.\
However her family factotum believes she was murdered by her partner.\
"When I arrived at her house Seemed it had been washed her body," recalls Mrs Buendia.\
There were signs she'd been beaten, and rigor mortis had set in. Already.\
As her mother recounts the story, a picture of Mariana looks down from the walls, next to a cross bearing a single word: Justice.\
However, That is exactly what the family say doing lot been denied.\
The state Authorities have Treated me like I'm an old gossip, a trouble-maker, a whiner.\
What they want is That One simply accepts what they say and shuts up.\
"That can not be right But When there were so many Irregularities and omissions," she says.\
As Pena Nieto President Receives The sash on Saturday, it comes with a heavy responsibility.\
Tens of Thousands of families Have Been Affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority During his time in office.\
"I hope he's the same kind of president as I was a governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.\
That, however it, is exactly what victims' families in Ciudad Neza Most fear.\
Bradley Manning did not complain about mistreatment, prosecutors contend\
Prosecutors try to counter Bradley Manning's claims of abuse in confinement\
The hearing Focuses on Manning's time in the military brig at Quantico, Virginia\
Defense wants case dismissed on grounds That Manning's confinement was harsh\
The Army private is Accused of stealing Thousands of classified documents\
Prosecutors tried to Establish That Friday Army private Bradley Manning - charged in the largest leak of classified materials in U.S. history - Multiple Opportunities missed to complain about the mistreatment he's alleging've Suffered in military custody.\
While cross-examining Manning at a pre-trial hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland, Maj prosecutor. Asserted That Ashden Fein records of weekly visits with unit officers had Manning During nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints acerca his treatment.\
The cross-examination - During a hearing on a defense motion To Have Manning's case dismissed on grounds That his confinement have been harsh and has amounted to enough punishment - came a day after Manning testified That I had Considered suicide while in custody.\
The Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is Accused of stealing Thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.\
The equipment was then published online by WikiLeaks.\
WikiLeaks has never confirmed That Manning was the source of its information.\
In Friday's hearing, reviewed with Manning Fein That the officers filled out forms after Meeting with Manning During his detention at Quantico's brig, where I was held under a heightened confinement status from July 2010 to April 2011.\
Officers Manning would ask questions and write down his responses.\
When Fein Asked about the forms Friday, Manning Acknowledged That He rated his treatment by guards as "excellent" and overall treatment by the facility as "very professional."\
The forms show no complaints of mistreatment, even though the officers Asked his treatment acerca Directly Manning, Fein contended.\
Respond Manning That He would verbally express concern acerca issues and That the visiting officers would talk through the Concerns and Indicate That They would be addressed, but They did not record the issues.\
"They would write down 'no issues' (after discussing the concerns), and it did not Necessarily mean I did not bring something up," Manning said.\
The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, Manning Also Asked why I did not complain about his treatment During a January 2011 meeting with a board examining the suicidal thoughts in a form I expresaron months earlier.\
Manning replied That his intention During That meeting was to get his "prevention of injury" status downgraded.\
The military said They put him on this restrictive status - a step below suicide watch - for his protection and the safety of others.\
"I wanted staff to know I was fine, and (I wanted to) get off the POI status ... to enjoy an Increased quality of life from my viewpoint," Manning said.\
Manning testified Thursday acerca his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where I was held for nearly two months before being transferred is to the brig at Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in July 2010.\
I said I Contemplated Suicide in Kuwait and eleven o'clock there passed out due to the heat.\
I said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was distressing.\
"My world just shrink to Camp Arafjon, To That cage," Manning said Thursday.\
I thought I was going to die in That cage.\
Once at Quantico, Manning said, I spend most days in a small cell - At least 21 hours and Often more than 23 hours - with no company.\
Manning said I was allowed only a mattress, blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.\
I said I tried to keep moving, Because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules.\
Manning said've always slept with light from outside his cell in his eyes.\
If guards Could not see his face When I rolled over at night, They said I would wake him to roll back over.\
Manning's lawyer filed a Formal objection to Manning's treatment in January 2011.\
Manning was moved to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.\
Also Friday, the judge Asked That Manning acerca have an allegation made in Thursday's testimony - that after being forced to sleep naked one night in his cell Quantico, I was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates During a morning head count .\
Manning had testified Given That I was never a chance to cover himself With His blanket During The head count.\
Under questioning from the judge Friday, Manning said That I inferred from his guard's order That I Should drop a blanket That Could have covered him, but I Acknowledged That no one had ordered him to drop it.\
Manning testified Thursday That I was forced to sleep naked the previous night Because of his Attempt to show an officer That I was not a danger to himself.\
Manning said the officer That He Told That He Could have used the waistband of his underwear or his flip-flops to hurt himself but Had not done so.\
That night, Manning testified, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.\
His lawyers hope the judge will take his experiences at Least During confinement into account and sharply reduce his sentence Should I be Convicted at his court-martial, que is expected to begin early next year.\
The defense has said it plans To Have Manning plead guilty to lesser charges Offenses and fight other as being too extreme.\
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend, With prosecutors expected to argue That the detention conditions were warranted.\
The Pentagon has maintained That Manning was held in Accordance with Rules governing government all maximum-custody detainees at Quantico.\
Counts against Manning include aiding the enemy, wrongfully Causing intelligence to be published on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or records.\
If he's Convicted on all counts, I Could face a life sentence.\
My Mexican-American identity crises\
He says many were forced to leave Mexico Because of the lack of Opportunities there\
Mexicans outstretch to fault Those Who left; They remind Mexicans of hard times, I says\
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans are caught Between Two Worlds\
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had barely made my way down the concourse and arrived at the immigration processing area when i got stumped.\
Signs pointed the way to two lines: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for "Aliens" ("Foreigners.")\
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of where to go.\
Growing up in Central California, I had been called a "Mexican" my entire life.\
It's ethnic shorthand in the same way That my friends in Boston refer to Themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York describes Themselves as "Italian."\
Later, I Settled on "Mexican-American."\
But, I this was Mexico.\
And, in the homeland of my grandfather, there was no need for shorthand or hyphens.\
I was simply an American.\
I speak English, good enough to handle Either end of an interview in That language.\
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native, and I can not shake my American accent.\
So I took my U.S. passport and got in the line for Foreigners.\
About That moment I thought this week When Mexican president-elect Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to Meet With President Obama.\
On the Agenda, as usual, When the leaders of These two country clubs meet: immigration, drugs and trade.\
Also Pena Nieto was eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, que That is one reason Mexicans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States.\
He wants to partner With The United States and Canada, and create a European Union-style trading bloc in North America.\
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartels, even though no specifics have offered Preferred.\
For Mexico, the relationship With The United States is complicated and filled with hard feelings.\
Most Americans probably never give a thought to the fact That, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half Their territory at the point of gun.\
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, the reminders are everywhere.\
So the minute That a U.S. official says anything The Least bit critical of Mexico, you start hearing - in the Mexican press, and Among the elites - acerca complaints how the Americans are encroaching upon Their neighbor's sovereignty.\
And the children of Montezuma go on the warpath.\
And yet, for Mexico, the really challenging With The relationship is more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.\
You want to talk acerca hard feelings?\
There is plenty.\
Mexico has winners and losers, people For Whom the country Provides Opportunities For Whom and others it does not.\
The only reason You have so many people of Mexican ancestry living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is Because, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent, who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.\
And More Often than not, That person fit to profile - dark skin, little education, from a poor village, etc..\
We're Their offspring, and we're loyal to them.\
Not Mexico.\
And even though May we now be living the American Dream, having gone to good schools and taken good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact That it's the American Dream we're living, and not the Mexican one.\
Our identity Might sometimes be fuzzy, but our loyalty is clear.\
It's to the United States.\
Besides, we're aware That many of the elite in the ruling class Mexicans do not like us.\
The feeling is mutual.\
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as inferior stock sufficiently It That Is not Mexican.\
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.\
Our existence is, Peak Gust see it, all about failure.\
If our families Had not failed in Mexico, They would not have left.\
And we would not now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain, living well in the United States but Nonetheless lost souls.\
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is friction Between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans Because Mexicans have a firmer grasp of Who They are and Mexican-Americans resent that.\
While she's a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as a part of two countries.\
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know do not feel like they're a part of either.\
We love listening to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, But Also to Bruce Springsteen.\
You get the best of both worlds, but you're rooted in neither.\
In Mexico, we're seen as Americans.\
And in the United States, we're Canadian Considered.\
Now, to complicate the relationship even further, as I learned During my trip, some Mexican leaders and parts of the intelligentsia want to reconnect With The Diaspora.\
They want to put Mexican-Americans to work as makeshift "ambassadors" for Mexico, Representing its interest in the United States.\
We would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to Strengthen Ties with Mexico.\
Yeah.\
That's not going to happen.\
Too many hard feelings.\
And, With income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure That it is a great country.\
I'm afraid you're on your own, folks.\
That's fair.\
At least some Mexicans If aren't yet ready to forgive the United States for how it Treated Mexico to century and a half ago, then doing lot to accept the fact That some Mexican-Americans still hold a grudge for how Their family members were Treated much more recently than that.\
Hmmm.\
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.\
Old battles, new Middle East\
The ceasefire Between Israel and Hamas Could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace\
Can there ever be a lasting peace Between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?\
Another round of bloodshed Suggests That any such hope is vain.\
Amid the usual futile arguments over who started it, scores of buildings Have Been reduced to rubble, more than 140 palestinians, most of it them Civilians, and six Israelis Have Been killed, and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.\
But though the Israelis and palestinians seem stuck in Their ancient conflict, all around them the Middle East is changing.\
The Arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air, and, like it or not, the palestinians and Israelis are caught up in the regional turmoil.\
Maybe this will Make Their struggle bloodier than before.\
However, there are Reasons for thinking It could just break Their lethal stalemate.\
A War That is neither lost or won\
At first sight, optimism looks very hard to justify now.\
Even if the ceasefire holds Agreed on November 21st, this week's fighting has Strengthened the hawks on Both Sides.\
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement That has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim To Have forced the Israelis to back off, even though Gaza has taken a drubbing.\
DESPITE killing some of its leaders and bottling up Gaza's 1.7m people in One of the most wretched and crowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.\
Indeed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank, the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.\
Moreover, Hamas's leaders may well Conclude That Time is on Their Side.\
As Islamists across the Arab World Have Gained clout, so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends.\
Turkey, a regional power resurgent That was eleven o'clock Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken up Hamas's cause, so you Qatar, one of the richest and Most dynamic of the Gulf states.\
Jubilant people say Hamas is an Islamist crescent curving around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hizbullah party-cum-militia holds sway, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist bent May topple Bashar Assad, and on down through Jordan, where Hamas's allies are menacing the king.\
Above all, on Israel's southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far The most populous and pivotal of Arab countries, has changed the region's balance.\
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011, had little time for Hamas.\
By contrast, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion.\
In May future Hamas diplomacy emerges as an Actor That can not be shut out even by Israel and America.\
Meanwhile, Israel's hardliners will draw the opposite conclusions.\
In military terms, Hamas has been put back in its box.\
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proved Please its worth and many of Hamas's missiles Have Been destroyed.\
Israelis will sleep more soundly - for a while.\
In diplomatic terms, America is as steadfast as ever, many European country clubs Also Blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence.\
Above all, Israel has prospered, Especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has Largely ignored the peace process.\
Although rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been fairly free of suicide-bombers, thanks in part to the barrier That bites into the West Bank, the main chunk of a would-be Palestinian state, and Protects the Jewish settlements continue to expand DESPITE That Their illegality in international law.\
Mr Netanyahu, Likud party has merged Whose With An even more hawkish lot under Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to an election on January 22nd, is sitting pretty.\
Why coddle Those twisty palestinians by giving them a state of Their Own?\
If They really ran the West Bank, They would not fire rockets, just as Have Done Their compatriots in Gaza?\
Better to keep them behind that wall and smite them If They raise Their Heads.\
Maybe the hardliners will win out, yet the Arab Spring May change Their calculations.\
Even if the Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel, Their priority will be tackling Difficulties at home.\
Israel's defense budget is bigger than That of its four Arab neighbors combined.\
Starting a Local With The superpower war will hardly help the new Arab Governments mend Their Economies.\
That the pragmatic Mr Morsi worked with Barack Obama to Obtain a ceasefire augurs well - and Might just mark the start of something.\
Should Israelis too look to the longer term.\
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving palestinians of Their right to self-determination is creating a powder keg That is bound one day to explode in the territories occupied by Israel - much as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.\
Already Repression is undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this as the Arab population swells.\
Bloody missions against Gaza every few years to knock back Hamas will exact a toll diplomatic growing.\
Both sides need prodding by outsiders\
The answer Remains the one trumpeted by sensible people on BOTH SIDES, most of it the outside world And This newspaper: two states, With Israel ceding territory for security.\
The hope - a small one in the short term - Is that the ceasefire will give a little more leverage to outsiders pushing That cause.\
Egypt, que must now set about stopping the flow of arms into Gaza, along with turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the notion of a Jewish state based on the 1967 boundaries with Land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.\
Also Should outsiders Arab press Hamas and Fatah to come together.\
That would do more to create a Palestinian state than the imminent virtual bid for statehood at the UN.\
Mr Obama Also has a part in getting Israel to the table.\
During his first term, I neglected to present his own plan for peace.\
Back in the White House, he is looking just as reluctant to be drawn in.\
This is woefully short-sighted.\
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.\
That means a peace settlement Between Israel and the palestinians.\
Cigarette plain packaging laws eats into force in Australia\
Smoking warnings and diseased body parts on dull green boxes emblazoned That are the same for all tobacco brands\
Australia's world-first laws on cigarette and tobacco plain packaging have eaten into force, brand logos and colors Replacing with generic coverings drab olive green, gruesome pictures of diseased body parts and depictions of children and babies made ill by Their parents' smoking.\
Apart from the varying health warnings and images the only Difference between the packs, mandatory from Sunday, are the brand names, and These are all printed in small font identical.\
It is the world s most strict regime for the packaging of tobacco.\
Australia's federal government says the aim is to deter young people from smoking by stripping the habit of glamor.\
It is Relying on studies showing That if People Have not started smoking by age 26 there is a 99% chance They will never take it up.\
"Even from a very early age kids See That you can understand the message That the tobacco company is trying to sell Through Their branding," said the federal health minister, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies Showed That, for example, linking a crown in children a logo With The notion of being a princess.\
While Australia has one of the world's deals, most hotels smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on Multinationals' profits, Considering other country clubs are like steps.\
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the laws.\
They said FIRMS Tobacco black market would boost trade, leading to cheaper, more accessible cigarettes.\
"There will be serious unintended consequences from the legislation," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.\
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring lots more of These products down to sell on the streets of Australia.\
Others say the laws have boosted Their business.\
Sandra has of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for cigarette cases, silicon covers to mask the unpalatable packages, had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the laws in Australia's high court.\
It said Zico had sold up to 6,000 to wholesale outlets and was awaiting new stock.\
This is good business for us.\
The potential hitch, experts say, is the Popularity of Social Media With The very demographic the plan is targeting.\
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising and sports sponsorship and Requiring Most sellers to hide cigarettes from view, tobacco marketing has moved online.\
Australia has banned the local web advertising by companies and sites but can not restrict overseas sites.\
"If you are a tobacco marketer and you've only got this small window left to Promote your products, online is the compelling place for you to be in," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.\
Noted Freeman an Increase in "average Joe" reviews of brands on social media sites: such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.\
We have to ask, Is that just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and they've gone to the trouble of making a video, or is there a marketing company Involved?\
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry was focused on dealing With The new rules rather than marketing.\
The industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - denying they are the country clubs at the World Trade Organisation That trade is being unfairly restricted, none of the country clubs DESPITE having significant trade with Australia.\
A WTO ruling is likely in mid-2013.\
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other like country clubs Considering laws on packaging.\
Canada was the first country to make warnings mandatory photograph in 2001.\
They now extend to more than 40 country clubs Including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.\
Tougher laws are Being Considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.\
Many smokers in Australia REMAIN defiant.\
The pictures do not Affect me.\
I just ignore them.\
"You just grab a smoke and put it away," said Victor El Hage as I Purchased a pack with a photograph of a mouth Tumour.\
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.\
James Yu, who runs the King of the Pack tobacconist in central Sydney, said the uniform packaging made it harder to stack his shelves\
"It used to take me an hour to unload a delivery, now it Takes me four hours," Yu said.\
"The government Should've just banned them altogether and then we'd go OK, fine, we're done, we'll shut up shop," I said, throwing his hands up in the air.\
In a Constantly Plugged-In World, It's Not All Bad to Be Bored\
I spent five hours in an airport unexpected this Thanksgiving holiday When our plane had mechanical Difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.\
So I had plenty of time to think about the subject of boredom.\
I will not lie to you.\
Half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty tedious, even With The distractions of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shopping).\
But increasingly, some academics and child development experts are coming out in praise of boredom.\
It's all right for us - and our children - to be bored on occasion, they say.\
It forces the brain to go on interesting tangents, Perhaps Fostering creativity.\
And Because most of it us are almost consistently plugged into one screen or another These Days, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.\
So should we embrace boredom?\
Yes.\
And no.\
But I'll get back to that.\
First of all, like many people, I Assumed That relativamente boredom was a recent phenomenon, With The advent of more leisure time.\
Not so, says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).\
"Boredom actually has a very long history," I said.\
There's boredom acerca Latin graffiti on the walls of Pompeii dating from the first century.\
Then there's the question of how we define boredom.\
The trouble Is that it has been defined, and discussed This, in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.\
After looking over the research literature and putting the thought in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "wanting to, but being unable to engage in satisfying activity."\
What separates boredom from apathy, I said, Is that the person is not engaged but wants to be.\
With apathy, I said, there is no urgent need to do something.\
The core experience of boredom, I said, is "disruption of the attention process, Associated with a low mood and a sense That time is passing slowly."\
Boredom can sound an awful lot like depression.\
But Professor Eastwood Said That While They can be related, people who are bored outstretch to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves.\
Sometimes we think we're bored When We Just have difficulty concentrating.\
In Their study, "The unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention, of" which Appeared in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an experiment in Which Earlier participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.\
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it at a low level so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.\
The ones who heard the low-level TV Reported boredom more than the other two groups - they experienced difficulty concentrating but were not sure why, and Attributed That difficulty to boredom.\
When you're trying to focus on a difficult task or Engaging, disruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.\
On the other hand, when you're doing something dull, "such as looking for bad widgets on a factory line, distracting music can help you not be bored."\
In fact, I said, we now know That squirming and doodling, Often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it by keeping people more alert Physically.\
"Research shows That kids who are allowed to fidget learn more and retain more information than Those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske said.\
We all experience boredom at some points - my flight delay, a droning speaker, a Particularly tedious movie.\
But some Individuals are more likely to be bored than others.\
To help measure This, Researchers developed a "Boredom proneness Scale" in the 1980s.\
The scale includes questions like, "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests, I do not have time to do everything."\
Using Such scales, Researchers have discovered That boys outstretch to be bored More Often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, Especially when it comes Needing more, and a variety of, external stimulation.\
But in general teenagers are a pretty jaded lot.\
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, Conducted an experiment in Which He Contacted almost 400 teenagers and Their parents seven to eight times a day by pager.\
I found That 32 percent of teens said They were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said They Were When They weren bored in school.\
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said They were bored.\
Professor Larson said I did not know Whether the boredom Percentages now, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.\
But I said I did Know That "adolescence is a peak period for boredom," Largely Because children and teenagers are Not Given a lot of Control over What They want to do.\
So back to my Original question: Is boredom good for you?\
Sometimes not, Because in its extreme it can lead people to take physical absurd Risks, gamble or indulge in substance abuse as a way to ease it, research shows.\
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the connection Between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the issue for more than two medical support.\
"Boredom is the brain's way to tell you you Should be doing something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU\
But the brain does not always know the Most appropriate thing to do.\
If you're bored and use That energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.\
But if you watch TV, May it make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.\
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, I May not be bored anymore, but I Has not learned how to entertain himself, or self Regulate, Professor Fenske said.\
And "that self-regulation transfers from one situation to other," I said.\
Your kid does not just learn to entertain himself, but gets more self-monitoring in other areas.\
I do not think we really want to celebrate boredom.\
Nor should we be too critical of it.\
Rather, our goal Should be to feel comfortable away from the constant chatter of activity and technology.\
Professor Eastwood agreed.\
"We frame it as we need to be more bored, but boredom is an agonizing, restless desire to be connected with something meaningful," I said.\
What people are really searching for, I said, is a way to unplug and enjoy down time.\
"In an environment where we are Constantly overstimulated," I said, "it's hard to find ways to engage When the noise shuts down."\
In Colorado, No Playbook for New Marijuana Law\
Anthony Orozco, 19, a community college student and soccer player in southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal charges for something That will soon be legal across this state: the possession of a few nuggets of marijuana and a pipe I used to smoke it.\
That Mr. Orozco said one day in September I and a few friends were driving in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, When They were pulled over.\
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for possession and drug paraphernalia - petty Offenses That each carry a $ 100 fine - and Given to court date.\
"We get treated like criminals," Mr. Orozco said.\
But is he one?\
In the uncertain weeks after Colorado's vote to legalize small Amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in Hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location.\
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana cases are Already being dropped here and in Washington State, que approved to the same measure.\
Police Departments have stopped charging adults 21 years and older for small-scale possession That will be legally sanctioned eleven o'clock the laws take effect in the coming weeks.\
But prosecutors in more conservative precincts in Colorado have vowed to press ahead with existing marijuana cases and are still citing people for possession.\
At the same time, several towns from the Denver suburbs to the Western mountains are voting to block new, state-licensed marijuana retail shops from opening in Their communities.\
"This thing is so quickly Evolving That I do not know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.\
Regulators in Washington State are scratching Also Their Heads.\
And They are looking for guidance on how to set-up a system of licenses for production, manufacturing, distribution and sales - all by a deadline of Dec. 1, 2013.\
They say that Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of Most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now recreationally.\
"Colorado has a more regulated market, So They will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a Spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.\
But no place or system, Mr. Smith conceded, can do more than suggest what might work.\
"There's no precedent for us to actual follow," I said.\
Washington's law, called I-502, Takes effect on Dec. 6, que Also leaves a year of limbo During Which the state licensing system will not yet exist, but will legalized possession.\
And there are thorny mechanical questions That must be resolved During That Time, like how to balance the state's mandate of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana With its Prohibitions on cannabis businesses Within 1,000 feet of a school, park, playground or child care center.\
"Nowhere will it be more Difficult to site a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, Particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a Spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a research group recently Formed.\
On Nov. 21, Chief Oates his officers in Aurora sent an e-mail announcing That the city attorney would no longer be prosecuting marijuana Violations small for anyone 21 years or older, and That the police would stop charging people for Those crimes "effective immediately . "\
Chief Oates Said That the police would enforce city codes regulating medical marijuana growers, and That They would still Pursue drug traffickers and dealers.\
In northern Colorado's Weld County, the district attorney, Ken Buck, dealer to a stricter view.\
After the vote, I said his office would continue pursuing marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to press getting users into treatment.\
Right now, 119 people face charges of Possessing two ounces or less of marijuana, though many are facing other charges.\
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute crimes Offenses That Were They occurred at the time," Mr. Buck said in a statement.\
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.\
The police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, are no longer citing adults for possession of small amounts.\
The county's district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supported That decision, But Also DECIDED not to dismiss all of the pending possession cases.\
"I do not think I'm wasting my time Continuing to enforce the law until it changes," I said.\
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the folds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple.\
And the contradictory reactions across the state lay bare to Local Officials Among deep ambivalence about the state's big green experiment.\
"It's a cultural barrier" with district attorneys, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who marijuana dealer to the local defendants and is a Spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.\
"They spent so much of Their Lives prosecuting People that they still do not really accept That this is legal," I said.\
As the first states to treat small Amounts of Marijuana like Alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to Become national test cases for drug legalization.\
As advocates and state Officials plan for a new frontier of legalized sales, They are Also anxiously awaiting direction from the federal government, que still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.\
Advocates for legalized marijuana are hoping the Justice Department yields.\
DESPITE some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has mostly allowed to operate medical marijuana businesses in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.\
While drug agents will probably not beat down doors to seize a small bag of the drug, They are likely to balk at the state-regulated Allowing recreational marijuana shops allowed under the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration.\
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal Authorities to act.\
Even before Election Day, some Local Governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana shops, even though it will be acerca a year before any can open.\
Last week, the western city of Montrose took up a six-month ban, and is likely to pass it next week.\
"We do not want to be put in a position where we license somebody and then have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a City Council member.\
Our community voted against this amendment.\
We're looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for.\
There's an awful lot of questions.\
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford for being a Tory\
It is not just today's university students who are Attacked for Their views\
I can not remember a time when i did not dream of winning a place at Oxford University.\
Both my father and my elder brother had been at what I imagined was the world's greatest seat of learning, a modern-day symposium Greek wine-blushed encouraging the dual pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.\
Yet, Within two weeks of taking up my place at Worcester College in the late Eighties to read history, I'd packed my bags, precipitating the first scandal of my life.\
My father broke down and cried.\
Friends were baffled.\
The Evening Standard diary Claimed'd quit because i objected to fellow undergraduates having sex in the room next to mine.\
The writer A N Wilson Announced that I'd departed waggishly Because I was forced to drink out of chipped mugs.\
The truth was less droll.\
I ran away.\
Yes, ran, because i had been subject to systematic bullying and intimidation.\
Not on account of my rather outr\'e9 name, or the fact That I came from a private school.\
I was Persecuted for one reason only, and In this cradle of enlightenment it was supposed Both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-profile adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative supporter.\
Why bring this up now, You Might ask.\
Well, recent reports suggest That a new generation of Right-of-center students are suffering to the same persecution.\
Such is the Institutionalised and Increasing hatred of Tory students at Oxford that last week a group of them Demanded the same equal-protection rights as gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.\
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's junior common room (JCR) claim They are "often Actively isolated, personally Attacked and made to feel unwelcome" Because of Their political views.\
They want to create a post on the College's Equal Opportunities committee to Ensure That Their opinions can be aired freely.\
Their situation was not Helped by a recent BBC Two documentary, Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, acerca student politics, que Tories Portrayed as oddballs and neo-Nazis.\
It featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), traveling in a Rolls-Royce, sporting a silver suit and silver-topped cane.\
At other universities, students say Conservative They are being Treated as "Scapegoats" for the introduction of higher tuition fees. "\
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of Nottingham University Conservative Association, a Sunday newspaper Told That "there is a growing Left-wing bias at universities.\
People assume we are like the Bullingdon Club meeting without us. "\
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who Proposed the motion for Greater protection, says Such a climate is "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cherill, 19, president elect of OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are Right of center.\
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the welfare of members," she says.\
I was in a minority of one During my first few weeks at Oxford.\
I had gone up in September 1986, a cripplingly shy 18-year-old.\
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at its Most febrile.\
The year before, the university had voted to refuse Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree, Because of cuts in higher education funding.\
The atmosphere Would have made a Stalinist shudder with apprehension.\
During the first few days of freshers' week, When new students socialize With Each Other and the dons, I had a taste of the wormwood That was to come.\
I was to find That the dons not only connived in the taunting of Tory undergraduates but took part with relish.\
The politics of the miners 'strike, Privatisation and the government's opposition to' sanctions against apartheid South Africa were Brought into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.\
My first one Involved translating 18th-century French texts into Ingl\'e9s, and I was unprepared for what Followed.\
"Miss Wyatt," said the don, Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."\
I stumbled over it.\
A small man with a face like cake batter, Pitt was big on bile.\
"Do Thatcherites refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" I Demanded.\
The other undergraduates giggled.\
Tears pricked the back of my eyes.\
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time - that is, if you're not too busy socializing," Pitt snarled.\
I walked back to my rooms a disconsolate figure.\
At dinner in college That evening I sat by myself, then I felt a light tap on my shoulder.\
It was a second-year student named James who Ingl\'e9s Introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.\
"I know who you are," I said kindly.\
I'm afraid it's like that.\
Anyone Suspected of being a Tory is picked on.\
It's bad enough for me, but They know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.\
Most Tory freshers pretend they're Labour.\
Later, at a Local Pub, I cravenly Attempted to dissimulate.\
That I insisted I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.\
This ploy proved Please unsuccessful.\
A first year PPE student, who, ironically, had been to Eton, said: "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."\
're Contaminated.\
Other students took up the refrain.\
I was perverted, dirty.\
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked.\
They beat each other, do not they?\
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the Sixties.\
Would I ever Be Able to lead a regular life at Oxford?\
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?\
Would I have to turn to Labour and naturally suppress my inclinations?\
The three years before I stretched out as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.\
The only Openly Tory Don was Norman Stone, Professor of Modern History, who was based at my college.\
I was hated for being not only a Conservative but a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her speech writers.\
I was hardly ever there.\
I loathed the place as provincial and petty, and for its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.\
In 1997 I took up a professorship at the University of Bilkent, in Ankara, Turkey.\
"You will be happy here," I told me.\
I Began commuting from Oxford to my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded metropolitan friends and family.\
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.\
I was incredulous.\
During his time there in the Forties, all political views had been accepted.\
"But it's the best place in the world," I said pathetically.\
They would not do that, not Among my dreaming spiers.\
Even my Communist friends always had impeccable manners.\
His rheumy eyes Began to cloud.\
Give it a chance.\
I'm sure it's all just a tease.\
It would break my heart if you left.\
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.\
A male friend of mine, Also a Tory supporter, had succumbed to pressure and Renounced his creed.\
During a tutorial the Following week, When Don had another Suggested history, in complete seriousness, That I was an "enemy of the people," I Decided to do the same.\
Inwardly blushing with shame, I ADMITTED to being "brainwashed by my parents" and called them "old fools."\
The respite was short.\
It was my father who drove the nail into the coffin of my Oxford career.\
At the time, I wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week.\
My door was locked.\
I cowered inside, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.\
When They left, I packed a suitcase and caught the first train to London.\
I never went back.\
You May call me a snivelling wimp.\
But not 18-year-old Should be subject to Such intimidation and vitriol in an educational institution.\
Even more tragic Is that it was Oxford, que Tory not only produced 14 prime ministers, but, to this day, hides behind an ill-deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.}
